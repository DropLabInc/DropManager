GOOGLE CHAT WEEKLY STATUS BOT - PROJECT OUTLINE
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
Build a fully automated Google Chat-based weekly status collection system that:
- Automatically onboards employees and tracks their weekly updates
- Uses AI/ML to classify updates by project with minimal human intervention
- Proactively reminds employees and escalates to managers when needed
- Provides real-time dashboard visibility into team activity and project health
- Allows controlled manual overrides without disrupting automation

CORE PRINCIPLE: Automation-first with human override capability
- Default behavior is fully automated end-to-end
- Every automated decision can be inspected and overridden by authorized users
- Overrides are audit-logged and feed back into the learning system
- Manual intervention is the exception, not the rule

GOALS
================================================================================
✓ Zero-manual intake: Employees simply DM the bot their updates
✓ Automated accountability: Timezone-aware reminders and escalations
✓ Automated organization: AI-powered project classification with confidence scoring
✓ Automated visibility: Live dashboard with metrics, trends, and exports
✓ Controlled overrides: Managers can correct misclassifications and tune settings

NON-GOALS (Initial Phase)
================================================================================
✗ Cross-platform support beyond Google Chat
✗ Manual tagging as part of normal workflow
✗ Complex project management features (Gantt charts, sprint planning)
✗ Performance review integration
✗ Deep HR workflows
